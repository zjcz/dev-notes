# Customise Grub
The following is a list of customisations that can be made to the Grub bootloader.

## Remember the last choice
To remember the last choice made in the Grub menu, edit the following file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Add the following lines to the file:

```
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
```

Save the file and update grub:

```bash 
sudo update-grub
```

### Note
If your computer is setup to dual boot with other OSes, the os-prober should detect these when you run `update-grub`. If it is disabled, you may need to add the following entry to the `/etc/default/grub` file and re-run `update-grub`:

```
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```
